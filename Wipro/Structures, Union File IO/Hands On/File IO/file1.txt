Once upon a time, there was a sage called Deva Sharma who lived in a temple in the outskirts of a town. He was widely known and respected. People would visit him, and offer him with gifts, food, money and garments to seek his blessings. The gifts that he did not need for himself, he would sell off, and got rich on the proceeds.
