A greedy mouse saw a basketfull of corn. He wanted to
eat it. So he made a small hole in the basket. He squeezed
in through the hole. He ate a lot of corn. He felt full. He
was very happy.
Hi All, Welcome to Wipro Technologies
Now he wanted to come out. He tried to come out
through the small hole. He could not. His belly was full. He
tried again. But it was of no use.
